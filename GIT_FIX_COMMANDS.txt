COPY AND PASTE THESE COMMANDS ONE BY ONE INTO YOUR TERMINAL:

# Step 1: Configure merge strategy
git config pull.rebase false

# Step 2: Pull and merge (this will create a merge commit)
git pull origin main --no-rebase

# Step 3: If you see merge conflicts, run these:
git add .
git commit -m "Merge remote changes"

# Step 4: Push your changes
git push origin main

# Step 5: If push still fails, force push (BE CAREFUL - this overwrites remote)
git push --force-with-lease origin main

ALTERNATIVE SIMPLE SOLUTION (if above doesn't work):

# This will force your local version to the remote
git push --force origin main
