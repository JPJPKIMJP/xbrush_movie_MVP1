# Video Sizing and Advanced Mode Box Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Video Sizing Issue in Step 8 (영상만다시제작 workflow)
**Problem**: Videos in Step 8 didn't fit properly in boxes with inconsistent aspect ratios and sizing.

**Root Cause**: Multiple conflicting CSS definitions for `.cut-video` and `.video-cut-preview` with different dimensions and improper `object-fit` values.

**Solution**:
- Unified all `.video-cut-preview` containers to use `aspect-ratio: 16/9` for consistent sizing
- Changed `object-fit: cover` to `object-fit: contain` to ensure videos fit properly within containers
- Added `display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center` for proper centering
- Enhanced mobile responsive behavior with consistent aspect ratios
- Added specific CSS rules for `.video-cut-container` to ensure consistent presentation

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/jpkim/moviemaker_mvp01/styles.css` - Lines 709-724, 1575-1587, 1946-1997, 1745-1747

### 2. Missing Advanced Mode Box in Step 7
**Problem**: Advanced Mode box disappeared after going through video clip regeneration workflows.

**Root Cause**: The `hideAdvancedEditAfterCompletion()` function was hiding the Advanced Edit section when certain workflow flags were set.

**Solution**:
- Modified Step 7 entry logic to always ensure Advanced Edit section is visible
- Updated `hideAdvancedEditAfterCompletion()` to keep the section visible instead of hiding it
- Removed aggressive hiding logic that was causing the box to disappear after video workflows
- Added proper flag management to show completion messages without hiding the interface

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes
```css
/* Enhanced video container sizing */
.video-cut-preview {
    aspect-ratio: 16/9;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.cut-video {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: contain;
    background: #000;
}
```

### JavaScript Changes
```javascript
// Always ensure Advanced Edit Mode is visible in Step 7
const advancedEditSection = document.getElementById('advancedEditSection');
if (advancedEditSection) {
    advancedEditSection.style.display = 'block';
    console.log('Advanced Edit Mode ensured visible in Step 7');
}
```

## Workflow Impact

### 영상만다시제작 (Video-Only Regeneration) Workflow:
1. User clicks "영상만 다시 제작" in Step 7
2. System navigates to Step 8 (Video Cut Selection)
3. Videos now display with proper aspect ratios and contain fitting
4. User can select cuts to regenerate and proceed
5. After completion, Advanced Mode box remains visible in Step 7

### Image Selection Workflow:
1. User can still access image selection options
2. Advanced Mode box remains visible throughout the workflow
3. No disruption to existing functionality

## Testing
- Created test file: `test_video_sizing.html` for visual verification
- All video containers now maintain 16:9 aspect ratio
- Advanced Mode box is always visible in Step 7 regardless of workflow path
- Mobile responsive behavior improved

## Browser Compatibility
- CSS `aspect-ratio` property is supported in modern browsers
- Fallback behavior maintained for older browsers
- `object-fit: contain` provides better cross-browser video scaling
